# Data-Power-and-Social-Work
 
This is the repository for the Data(,) Power and Social Work 'living resource' for MA Social Work students at the University of Sheffield and the social work community.

The initial commit includes two chapters by Dr Calum Webb. The first concerns whether data can be used in direct practice as a tool for identifying, working with, and implementing support for highly stigmatised experiences like poverty. The second chapter considers the political and rhetorical power of quantitative research, statistical analysis and data literacy, and the potential for its use in emancipatory action.

Each chapter includes an example video and an exercise. There is an embedded padlet board for discussion at the end of the page, as well as a list of references.

The intention for creating this 'living resource' is that other educators can fork, adapt, contribute to, and suggest corrections, to create a shared and evolving learning resource for social workers, academics and social work students.  You can make pull requests to add new chapters, add additional references, make corrections in the text, or add resources or exercises.
